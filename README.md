# FeatureSelectionWithCustumAlgorithm

Feature Selection with multiple classifier

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites


```
Numpy
Pandas 
sklearn
copy

```

### Installing

git clone  https://github.com/cpp-neuro/FeatureSelectionWithCustumAlgorithm.git

the name of the csv file is pass into the featureSelection constructor


python FeatureSelection.py


## Running the tests

There are examples in the main.
it works with sklearn library. you define the model then feature selection is run in that model
